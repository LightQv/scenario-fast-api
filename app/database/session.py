Database session management and configuration.

This module handles SQLAlchemy database engine creation, session management,

connection pooling and session lifecycle management.

    Database session dependency for FastAPI endpoints.

    This function creates a database session and ensures it's properly closed
    after use. It uses Python's generator pattern to guarantee cleanup even
    if exceptions occur during request processing.

    The session is configured with autocommit=False and autoflush=False for
    explicit transaction control, which is recommended for web applications.

    Yields:
        Session: SQLAlchemy database session

    Example:
        >>> from fastapi import Depends
        >>> def my_endpoint(db: Session = Depends(get_database_session)):
        ...     user = db.query(User).first()
        ...     return user

    Note:
        This function is typically used as a FastAPI dependency injection
        and should not be called directly in application code.
