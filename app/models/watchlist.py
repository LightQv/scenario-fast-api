    """
    Watchlist model for organizing user's media collections.

    This model represents user-created collections of movies and TV shows.
    Users can create multiple watchlists to organize their content by themes,
    genres, or any other criteria. Each watchlist belongs to a single user
    and can contain multiple media items.

    Attributes:
        id (UUID): Primary key - unique identifier for the watchlist
        title (str): User-defined name/title for the watchlist
        author_id (UUID): Foreign key reference to the User who created this watchlist

    Relationships:
        author: Many-to-one relationship with User model (watchlist owner)
        medias: One-to-many relationship with Media model (contained media items)

    Example:
        >>> watchlist = Watchlist(
        ...     title="Action Movies to Watch",
        ...     author_id=user.id
        ... )
        >>> db.session.add(watchlist)
        >>> db.session.commit()

    Note:
        When a watchlist is deleted, all associated media items are also deleted
        due to the cascade configuration. When a user is deleted, their watchlists
        are automatically deleted as well.
